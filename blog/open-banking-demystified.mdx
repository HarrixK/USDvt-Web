Open banking started as a regulatory mandate; it's quickly becoming the **de‑facto platform strategy** for modern financial services. In this post we unpack the core concepts and show where engineering teams should focus first.

## TL;DR

* **PSD2 & beyond →** Europe forced the door open. Other regions followed with self‑regulation or market pressure.  
* **APIs drive loyalty** more than mobile apps—developers integrate once, then stick for years.  
* **Data aggregation ≠ open banking.** Real‑time payment initiation is where the next 10× UX gains live.

## 1 — Standardised Access Layers

Open‑banking APIs boil down to three resource groups:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Group</th>
      <th>Endpoint examples</th>
      <th>Typical latency</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Accounts</td>
      <td>`/accounts`, `/transactions`</td>
      <td>300 – 800 ms</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Payments</td>
      <td>`/payments`, `/refunds`</td>
      <td>400 – 900 ms</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Metadata</td>
      <td>`/beneficiaries`, `/institutions`</td>
      <td>&lt;200 ms</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## 2 — Security Posture

1. **OAuth 2.1** with short‑lived tokens (5 – 10 min).  
2. **mTLS** is non‑negotiable in production.  
3. **JWT claims** must include consent scopes *and* PSU (end‑user) identifiers.

## 3 — Build vs Buy Checklist

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Question</th>
      <th>When to build</th>
      <th>When to buy</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>&lt;5 banks in target region?</td>
      <td>❌</td>
      <td>✅</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Proprietary data science pipeline?</td>
      <td>✅</td>
      <td>❌</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Need licenced payment initiation?</td>
      <td>❌</td>
      <td>✅</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Next Steps

* Prototype with a sandbox provider (e.g. Plaid Sandbox, Tink EU).  
* Add "link your bank" to staging behind a feature flag.  
* Measure **drop‑off vs identity‑verification UX**—that's where most POCs fail.
